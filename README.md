# B-Tech-Capstone-Project: Analyzing vulnerabilities associated to an IoT healthcare device

Today there are thousands of IoT based wearable devices available in the market. Most wearables collect data and send this data to a connected device mostly a smartphone over Bluetooth. The smartphone then collects all this data and may do a preliminary analysis for immediately warning the user for abnormalities in the readings. Apart from this the smartphone also sends all this collected data to the users doctor so that he can keep track of this patients vitals on the long run. However the feature for sending data to the doctor may be accessible to only users in major cities where their hospitals have the added facilities to collect, consolidate and maintain all this data. This work proposes a solution to enhance the security of the data collected during transmission on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks.
